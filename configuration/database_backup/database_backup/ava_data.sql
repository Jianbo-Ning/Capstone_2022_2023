This region, which encompasses 40 miles, includes both the Columbia Gorge AVA and part of the Columbia Valley.','Within the winegrowing region, the climate in the Columbia Gorge appellation changes drastically. To the west is a cooler, marine-influenced climate where it rains 36 inches per year; to the east it’s a continental high desert climate with just 10 inches of annual rainfall. This extreme variance of climate means this area can successfully grow a wide range of classical varieties.','The Columbia Gorge wine region soils are generally silty loams collected over time from floods, volcanic activity and landslides.','The Columbia River Gorge is a narrow, winding river valley whose walls range from steep volcanic rock faces to more gentle-sloped, terraced benchlands that are typically well suited for grape growing. The Gorge is the only sea-level passage through the Cascade Mountain Range. From north to south there are two iconic geographical features: Mt. Adams and Mt. Hood, both part of the central Cascade Mountain range','Albariño, Aglianico, Barbera, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Dolcetto, Gamay Noir, Gewürztraminer, Grenache, Grüner Vertliner, Lemberger, Malbec, Marsanne, Merlot, Mourvedre, Muscat, Nebbiolo, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Primitivo, Riesling, Roussanne, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier, Zinfandel.'),
    (nextval('ava_data_ava_id_seq'),'Columbia Valley','The Columbia Valley AVA is an extremely large growing region with 11 million acres of land. Most of Columbia Valley and its six sub-appellations lie in Washington State, with a small section in Oregon stretching from The Dalles to Milton-Freewater. The region is 185 miles wide and 200 miles long.','The region has a largely continental high desert climate. The hot days promote slow, even ripening, while the cool nights ensure that grapes retain their natural acidity. The area receives just 6 to 8 inches of annual rainfall, making supplemental irrigation a necessity throughout the AVA.','About 15,000 years ago a series of tremendous ice age floods (dubbed the Missoula Floods) deposited silt and sand over the area. These deposited sediments, along with wind-blown loess sediment, make up the area’s present-day soils, which are well drained and ideal for grapevines.','This is a huge area covering 11 million acres. Mostly, the Columbia Valley lies on the Columbia River Plateau and encompasses the valleys formed by the Columbia River and its tributaries, including the Walla Walla, Snake and Yakima rivers. Mountain ranges border the Columbia Valley region on the west and north, while the Columbia River acts roughly as a boundary to the south, and the Snake River near Idaho acts as the border to the east','Barbera, Black Muscat, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenere, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Counoise, Gamay Beaujolais, Gamay Noir, Gewürztraminer, Grenache, Lemberger, Malbec, Marsanne, Merlot, Morio Muskat, Mourvedre, Muscadelle, Muscat Canelli, Nebbiolo, Orange Muscat, Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir, Riesling, Roussanne, Royalty, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Siegerrebe, Syrah, Viognier, Zinfandel.'),

The AVA derives its name from the extremely rocky soils that underlie a region just north of the small town of Milton-Freewater. With an area of only 5.9 square miles, The Rocks District is the second smallest AVA in Oregon. The Rocks District is wholly contained within both Walla Walla Valley and Columbia Valley AVAs.','The Rocks District receives an insufficient average of 15 inches of annual precipitation, so vines are irrigated with water from the Walla Walla River fed by the Blue Mountains’ snowmelt. Growing season is mostly sunny with low humidity, so major daily temperature variations are common. During summers, the region often experiences five to 10 days with temperatures exceeding 100°F.','Its defining characteristic, The Rocks’ unique soil consists of pebbles and cobbles of basalt (a dark volcanic rock) in a matrix of sand and silt. The soil is extremely well drained, encouraging vines to root deeply, and the dark rocks efficiently transfer heat into the soils and radiate heat to the ripening fruit. It is the only AVA in the U.S. with boundaries determined by a single land form and a single soil series.','The Rocks District occupies a gently sloping alluvial fan deposited by the Walla Walla River, where it exits the foothills of the Blue Mountains and enters the broad flat floor of the Walla Walla Valley. Elevations range from 800 to 1,000 feet.','Cabernet Franc, Grenache, Malbec, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier.'),

Although a vast majority of this AVA’s wineries currently reside in Washington, almost half of the winegrowing acreage lies on the Oregon side.','Washington and Northern Oregon’s northern latitude position means long sunshine-filled days balanced by cool evening temperatures of the higher elevation. This temperature variation allows the grapes to develop their flavor and complexity while retaining their natural acidity. The appellation lies east of the Cascade Mountain Range, which limits the amount of rainfall to an annual 12.5 inches, allowing vintners to perfectly manage the plants through irrigation.','Walla Walla Valley soils come in varying combinations of well-drained loam, silt, loess and cobbles brought by a series of massive floods (dubbed the Missoula floods) some 15,000 years ago.','East of the Cascade Mountain Range, this area sits at the foot of the Blue Mountains, with vineyard elevations typically ranging from 650 feet to 1,500 feet.','Barbera, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenere, Chardonnay, Cinsault, Counoise, Dolcetto, Gewürztraminer, Malbec, Merlot, Nebbiolo, Petit Verdot, Pinot Noir, Sangiovese, Semillon, Syrah, Viognier.'),
    (nextval('ava_data_ava_id_seq'),'Rogue Valley','The Rogue Valley is the southernmost winegrowing region in Oregon. It’s made up of three adjacent river valleys (Bear Creek, Applegate and Illinois) that extend from the foothills of the Siskiyou Mountains along the California border north to the Rogue River. It is 70 miles wide by 60 miles long and encompasses the Applegate Valley sub-appellation.','Rogue Valley is made up of three distinct valleys with progressively warmer microclimates, which enables the region to successfully grow both cool- and warm-climate grape varieties. To the west, the region is affected by mountain and ocean influences, making it suitable for some cool-weather varieties, including Pinot Noir. Farther east, Rogue Valley has the highest elevations (nearly 2,000 feet) of Oregon’s winegrowing regions, but it is also the warmest and the driest, making it well suited for warm-weather varieties.','Rogue Valley soil types are many and varied, including mixes of metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic derived soils ranging from sandy loam to hard clay.','Vineyards here are typically at elevations of 1,200 to 2,000 feet and are planted on hillsides rather than valley floor. Rogue Valley’s diverse landscape is derived from the convergence of three mountain ranges of varying ages and structure: the Klamath Mountains, the Coastal Range and the Cascades. This region includes the Rogue River and its tributaries: the Applegate, Illinois and Bear Creek rivers.','Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenere, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Dolcetto, Gewürztraminer, Grenache, Malbec, Marsanne, Merlot, Montepulciano, Mourvedre, Müller-Thurgau, Muscat, Nebbiolo, Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Pinotage, Primitivo, Riesling, Roussanne, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Syrah, Tannat, Tempranillo, Touriga Nacional, Vermentino, Viognier, Zinfandel.'),
    (nextval('ava_data_ava_id_seq'),'Applegate Value','Applegate Valley is a sub-appellation of the Rogue Valley. It stretches 50 miles north from the California border to the Rogue River just west of Grants Pass.','Applegate Valley has a moderate climate that generally enjoys a warm, dry (just 25.2 inches of annual rain) growing season with hot days and cool nights perfect for warm-climate varieties.','Applegate Valley’s soil types are typically granite in origin, and most of the area’s vineyards are planted on stream terraces or alluvial fans, providing deep, well-drained soils that are ideal for high-quality wine grapes','Applegate Valley is surrounded by the Siskiyou Mountains, which were created by upthrusts of the ocean floor as a plate forced its way under the continental shelf. The Siskiyou National Forest borders the Applegate Valley to the west, and the Rogue River National Forest to the east. Vineyards are typically grown at higher elevations up to 2,000 feet.','Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Marsanne, Petite Sirah, Primitivo, Riesling, Rousanne, Sangiovese, Syrah, Tempranillo, Viognier, Zinfandel.'),
    (nextval('ava_data_ava_id_seq'),'Snake River Valley','The Snake River Valley AVA spans southwest Idaho and significant parts of Baker and Malheur counties in Eastern Oregon. The area is a massive 8,263 square miles. Its boundaries make up the now dry, 4 million-year-old Lake Idaho, which extends 149 miles northwest to southeast, from the Oregon-Idaho state line to just west of Twin Falls, Idaho. The major Oregon cities include Ontario and Baker City.','Located inland, and in the rain shadows of the Cascade, Sierra Nevada and Owyhee mountain ranges, the Snake River Valley receives just 10 to 12 inches of annual rainfall, most of which occurs in winter. This allows vintners to perfectly manage the plants through irrigation during the region’s relatively short (142 days on average) growing season. This area is also characterized by hot days and cool nights in summer. This drastic diurnal temperature variation helps balance natural acids and sugars, making the grapes ideal for premium winemaking.','There is a great variety of soil types in the Snake River Valley, predominantly sand, mud silts, loess and volcanic detritus on top of sedimentary rock. The soil types of the Snake River Valley are so diverse that soil is not a distinguishing factor in this appellation.','Snake River Valley encompasses the now dry Lake Idaho. With elevation between 2,165 and 3,412 feet, this basin area appears sunken compared to the surrounding mountains, which exceed 7,000 feet. Multiple mountain ranges provide a barrier from Pacific Northwest marine influences. Vineyard elevations go as high as 3,000 feet — higher than any other winegrowing regions in the Northwest; though, most of the vineyards in Snake River Valley are at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 feet.','Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Canadice, Chardonnay, Cinsault, Gewürztraminer, Grenache, Lemberger, Malbec, Merlot, Mourvedre, Riesling, Syrah.'),

It encompasses Umpqua Valley, Rogue Valley, Red Hill Douglas County and Applegate Valley AVAs.','While this region provides the warmest growing conditions in Oregon, there exist cool microclimates within its varied hillsides and valleys that enable Southern Oregon to successfully grow both cool- and warm-climate varietals. This area receives significantly less rainfall than other viticultural areas in Oregon (40 percent less than in the Willamette Valley) and is generally a warm, sunny, arid climate.','Southern Oregon’s soils are varied and complex, though generally derived from bedrock, specifically from the 200 million year old Klamath Mountains, which are comprised of sedimentary rocks, to the west.','The Southern Oregon AVA contains varied, mountainous features with vineyards typically situated in high mountain valleys at elevations between 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The lofty southern coastal mountains provide a barrier to the west, blocking marine air and casting a rain shadow to the area’s south and east.','Albariño, Baco Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Canelli, Carmenere, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Dolcetto, Gewürztraminer, Graciano, Grenache, Malbec, Marsanne, Merlot, Montepulciano, Mourvedre, Müller-Thurgau, Muscat, Nebbiolo, Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Pinotage, Primitivo, Riesling, Rousanne, Sangiovese, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Syrah, Tannat, Tempranillo, Touriga Nacional, Vermentino, Viognier, Zinfandel.'),
    (nextval('ava_data_ava_id_seq'),'Umpqua Valley','Umpqua Valley sits between the Coast Range to the west and the Cascades to the east, with the Willamette Valley to the north and the Rogue Valley, south. Named for the legendary fishing river that runs nearby, the appellation stretches 65 miles from north to south, and is 25 miles from east to west.','The Umpqua Valley can successfully grow both cool and warm varieties. It’s comprised of three distinct climatic sub-zones: 1) The northern area around the town of Elkton enjoys a cool, marine-influenced climate. It receives around 50 inches of annual rainfall, making irrigation unnecessary. Pinot Noir and other cool-climate varieties thrive here. 2) The central area to the northwest of Roseburg has an intermediate climate where both cool and warm varieties do well. 3) The area south of Roseburg is warmer and more arid, similar to Rogue and Applegate valleys to the south, making irrigation a necessity. Warm-climate varieties, including Tempranillo, Syrah and Merlot flourish here.','Umpqua Valley soils are as varied as the climate. Generally, they are derived from a mix of metamorphic, sedimentary and volcanic rock; though more than 150 soil types have been identified in the region. The valley floor levels have mostly deep alluvial or heavy clay materials, while the hillsides and bench locations have mixed alluvial, silt or clay structures — all excellent for winegrowing.','The complex topography of the Umpqua Valley is a result of the collision of three mountain ranges of varying age and structure: Klamath Mountains, Coast Range and Cascades. Many say the area should not be thought of as a single valley, but, rather, more accurately the “Hundred Valleys of the Umpqua” because it is made up of a series of interconnecting small mountain ranges.','Albariño, Baco Noir, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Dolcetto, Gewürztraminer, Graciano, Grenache, Malbec, Merlot, Muscat Canelli, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, Syrah, Tempranillo, Zinfandel.'),

A part of the Umpqua Valley AVA, it is named for the town of Elkton and claims the northernmost and lowest elevation region in the Umpqua.','Elkton Oregon is the coolest and wettest region within the larger Umpqua Valley and produces different varieties and different wine styles than the rest of the larger AVA. Elkton enjoys a cool, marine-influenced climate with a longer growing season than the rest of the Umpqua. The region receives about 50 inches of rain each year.','The AVA is dominated by the coastal mountain geology, lying over a combination of sedimentary, volcanic and metamorphic rock from the middle Eocene. More than 50 different soil series or complexes are present, made up of mostly residual clay and/or silt loam soil or cobble-rich alluvial deposits from the Yamhill and Tyee formation, and the Umpqua River terrace.','Elkton Oregon contains a wide range of terrain dissected by the broader meanders of the Umpqua River. The majority of the AVA falls below the 1,000-foot contour and includes the river bottom land — elevation 130 to 160 feet — as well as river terraces and foothills near the river — also 130 to 160 feet.','Baco Noir, Chardonnay, Gewürz., Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Riesling, Syrah'),
    (nextval('ava_data_ava_id_seq'),'Red Hill Douglas County','Red Hill Douglas County is a sub-appellation of the Umpqua Valley near the small town of Yoncalla, which lies about 30 miles north of Roseburg and parallels Interstate 5. It encompasses 5,500 acres and is a single-vineyard AVA — one of just a few in the country — with Red Hill Vineyard planted to 220 acres of vines.','Red Hill Douglas County has a relatively mild climate, with daytime averages of 75°F during growing season (as opposed to regions farther south that can experience highs of 105°F). The marine influence reaching this area also provides a wetter climate than the surrounding Umpqua Valley area. Thanks to its higher elevation, the area generally enjoys a frost-free growing season.','Red Hill Douglas County is dominated by iron-rich, red volcanic Jory soils, which were formed from ancient volcanic basalt and consist of silt, clay and loam soils. They are mostly deep and well drained to the 15-foot depth.','Elevation in this area ranges from the 800-foot contour line to 1,200 feet, the maximum elevation for quality grape production.

It runs from the Columbia River in Portland, south through Salem, to the Calapooya Mountains near Eugene. The Coast Range marks its west boundary and the Cascade Mountains mark the east.','Overall, the climate is mild. Winters are typically cool and wet; summers are dry and warm. Heat above 90°F only occurs 5 to 15 days per year, and the temperature drops below 0°F once every 25 years. Most rainfall occurs in the late autumn winter, and early spring, when temperatures are the coldest. The valley gets relatively little snow, 5 to 10 inches per year. This temperate climate, combined with coastal marine influences, make growing conditions ideal for cool-climate grapes, including Pinot Noir. The Willamette Valley’s warm days and cool nights during the growing season allow the fruit to develop flavor and complexity while retaining their natural acidity.','The Willamette Valley is an old volcanic and sedimentary seabed that has been overlaid with gravel, silt, rock and boulders brought by the Missoula Floods from Montana and Washington between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago. The most common of the volcanic type is red Jory soil, which is found above 300 feet (as it had escaped the Missoula Floods deposits) and is between four and six feet deep; it provides excellent drainage for wine grapes. Anything below 300 is primarily sedimentary-based soil.','The Willamette Valley is protected by the Coast Range to the west, the Cascades to the east and a series of hills to the north. The largest concentration of vineyards are located to the west of the Willamette River, on the leeward slopes of the Coast Range, or among the valleys created by the river’s tributaries. Most of the region’s vineyards reside a few hundred feet above sea level, with some exceptions.','Auxerrois, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Dolcetto, Gamay Noir, Gewürztraminer, Grüner Veltliner, Marechal Foch, Melon, Müller-Thurgau, Muscat, Muscat Ottonel, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Pinot Meunier, Pinot Noir, Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, Syrah, Tempranillo.'),

It is situated within an irregular circle of about 6,490 acres.','The Dundee Hills AVA is protected from severe climatic variations by surrounding geographic features. The Coast Range to the west helps weaken effects of the Pacific’s heavy rainfall and windstorms, and casts a rain shadow over the area, resulting in only 30 to 45 inches of annual precipitation, most of which falls outside of the growing season in the winter. Slope and elevation benefit vineyards with warmer nights and less frost and fog than nearby valley floors.','Dundee Hills is known for its rich, red volcanic Jory soils, which were formed from ancient volcanic basalt and consist of silt, clay and loam soils. They typically reach a depth of 4 to 6 feet and provide excellent drainage for superior quality wine grapes.','The Dundee Hills consists of a single, continuous landmass that rises above the surrounding Willamette Valley floors and is defined by the 200-foot contour line to the AVA’s highest peak of 1,067 feet. The area comprises a north-south spine with ridges with small valleys on its east, south and west sides.
