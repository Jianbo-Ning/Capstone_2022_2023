  # "url" is a regular expression; if the user types anything into the browser in the pattern {domain}/, this triggers.
  # "static_files" tells it which files should be served when this regular expression is matched.
  # "upload" tells gcloud which files to upload corresponding to static_files - in this case, it's the same.
  # This directs {domain}/ to the following FILE (touches ONE FILE).
  - url: /
    static_files: frontend/build/index.html
    upload: frontend/build/index.html

  # "url" is the prefix "/" + any characters (.*) + "." (\.) + any characters (.*)
  # This code instructs the application to substitute this prefix after "frontend/build/"
  # Ex: Browser wants {domain}/css/main.css; the prefix is "/" + "css/main" (any characters) + "." + "css" (any characters)
  # It will get the file found at frontend/build/{above prefix}
  # "upload" tells gcloud what files to upload (so that we can exclude unnecessary files - specifically, it will upload
  # the whole React build folder at "frontend/build".
  - url: /(.*\..*)$
    static_files: frontend/build/\1
